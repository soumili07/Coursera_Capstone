The demographics of Toronto, Ontario, Canada make Toronto one of the most multicultural and multiracial cities in the world. In 2016, 51.5% of the residents of the city proper belonged to a visible minority group, compared with 49.1% in 2011, and 13.6% in 1981. Toronto also has established ethnic neighbourhoods such as the multiple Chinatowns, Little Italy, Little India and Roncesvalles, which celebrate the city's multiculturalism.
